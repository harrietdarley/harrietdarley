# An Ultimate General Knowledge Quiz - Project Two
## About
This is my creation of a General Knowledge quiz. The aim of the game is for the player to attempt to answer the questions 
correctly about a variety of subjects in order to get a high score. 
### Why this project?
I built this game for an Interactive Frontend Development project. The purpose was to create a game using HTML, CSS & JavaScript,
however mainly focusing on JavaScript to develop functionality. 
I chose to build a quiz rather than any other game because it enabled me to improve areas of JavaScript that I didn't understand 
such as processing data. The project has definitely helped me learn a lot and strengthen my knowledge of JavaScript.
## UX
### User Stories 
As a player I want to:
- Be able to be able to read how to play, before and whilst playing the game
- Be able to listen to music and turn if off, before and whilst playing the game.
- Have the choice of difficulty
  - Playing on 'easy' mode means one has more time (one minute) to answer the question. 
  - Playing on 'hard' mode means one has less time (30 seconds) to answer the question.
- Be able to return home and stop the game. 
- Be able to pause and play the game. 
- Have four options to pick from. 
- After choosing an answer, be told which answer is correct by the answer turning green & be told which answer is incorrect by the answer turning red. 
- Move onto the next question if I can't answer. 
- Be told my score at the end of the game. 
### Research
Before starting to design my project, I looked at lots of versions of quizes to give me a good understanding of other designs 
and the range of functions they were using, helping me to start plan my game. 

One of my main focuses was to create a highly responsive and intuitive user interface to ensure a seamless experience for users. 

### Style Rationale 
The majority of quizes I looked at online had quite basic designs and layouts, and all the questions were on one 
page, therefore I decided that my game would be more responsive and look cleaner if each question had an individual page.

I chose a bright colour scheme and engaging and creative fonts to attract users to play the game. 

### Wireframes 
I created my designs using Abode XD, I displayed two different aspects; one from a laptop and one from a phone, to ensure my webpage would be responsive 
from a variety of technology.
